When the geometry file is loaded, user needs to specify the boundary conditions.
.....................................................................................
The boundary conditions refer to the locations within the geometry where a specific flow condition is specified.
For example 
1. an input velocity boundary condition where the flow enters the geometry at the specified velocity
2. The outlet boundary condition is where the flow will exit the geometry
3. The wall boundary condition is where the flow would see that part of the geometry as a wall.
4. The boundary conditions should be specified by clicking on the required face in the loaded geomerty file and right clicking it and a menu should appear
in which "Add to boundary condition" should appear. It should ask for a name by which the user can identify what boundary it is.
Like the user specified it as an inlet boundary. The on another face the user specified outlet name to that face.
Now when the user goes to the boundary condition menu, those inlet and outlet faces will be appearing.

In the inlet, the user can specify a certain boundary condition "inlet velocity or pressure or outlet or mass flow"
The same can be done at the outlet face.
Once the boundary conditions are specified, the user can now specify the properties of the fluid.
This will appear in the different menu. It should be called "material properties". As this relates to the properties of the fluid
that will be flowing in the geometry.
The properties of the fluid which I currently want is: density and viscosity. I will let you know more once you are doing that part.
Then once material properties are finished, the user now needs to specify "Simulation setup". This will include parameters:
Total number of divisions, total simulation time, simulation time step.
Please have these incorporated. I will let you know more once these are done.
